It\u2019s just shocking to watch, to be able to see him be so well-behaved.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many other parents are just as content, according to the Maryland Behavioral Health Integration in Pediatric Primary Care program\u2019s last quarterly report. Of 231 families who completed a satisfaction survey, 98.3% reported they would be likely or very likely to recommend the social work intern to a friend or family member.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Along with its internship, the program \u2014 known by the acronym BHIPP \u2014\u00a0 offers statewide, over-the-phone behavioral health consultation services in collaboration with the University of Maryland and Johns Hopkins School of Medicine.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The program that brings fledgling social workers into pediatric offices is part of the National Network of Child Psychiatry Access Programs.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Yet despite positive reviews from pediatricians and parents, of the 54 programs in the network, the Maryland program stands out as an exception.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Those other programs often offer hotlines to mental health services, but not access to a mental health professional embedded in a pediatrician\u2019s office.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI don&#8217;t know anyone else that&#8217;s partnering with a social work school,\u201d said Dr. John Straus, the founder of the network.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Partnering with universities could be a viable option for other access programs in states that struggle to maintain the workforce needed to address the demand for youth mental health services, Straus said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI&#8217;ve always known what Maryland was doing, but I hadn&#8217;t really thought about it nationally, and I think we need to promote it a bit more,\u201d he said. </span></p>\n<h2><b>&#8216;First line of defense&#8217;</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This school year, eight pediatric and family medicine practices in Wicomico, Somerset, Frederick and Washington counties have social work interns through the program.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The social work interns do behavioral health screenings, brief six-week interventions and coordination of resources and referrals, said program director Meghan Crosby Budinger. Interventions primarily consist of cognitive behavioral therapy and parent management training</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since the program began in 2012, its interns had conducted 12,160 visits with families as of mid-February, Crosby Budinger said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">DeCastro said providing behavioral health services in a primary care setting serves as \u201cthe first line of defense\u201d for youngsters who need that help.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In fact, about half of all pediatric check-ups consist of conversations about psychosocial, emotional, behavioral or educational concerns, according to a 2024 </span><a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1538544224001664?via%3Dihub#bib0027\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">academic paper</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> published in ScienceDirect.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cAll pediatric practices and family medicine practices that see kids need to be comfortable taking care of behavioral health issues,\u201d\u00a0 Straus said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite this, the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education has not required pediatricians to train in this field, Straus said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While its guidelines will change at the beginning of July to require a month of mental health training for new pediatricians, most current practitioners aren\u2019t equipped to deal with these issues and have sent families to look for help elsewhere. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The social work internship program offers a better, quicker alternative, DeCastro said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cBecause I&#8217;m here three days out of the week, sometimes from those regular checkups, the providers are able to just walk into the office and be like, \u2018Hey, there&#8217;s someone I&#8217;d like you to meet,\u2019 and I\u2019ll meet them in the exam room,\u201d he said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The program is both convenient and free, said Gabriel Simpson, a social work intern at Gateway Pediatrics in Salisbury, Maryland. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The program runs on funds from the state\u2019s Behavioral Health Administration, the Health Resources and Services Administration as well as grants from the federal government.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> That allows the program to offer its services with no charge to its patients or their insurance, thereby steering clear of problems that may otherwise arise regarding insurance coverage. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThe accessibility feature that comes along with the \u2026 program is, I think, invaluable,\u201d Simpson said.</span></p>\n<h2><b>A stepping stone</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">DeCastro said most of the issues he sees in young children are beginning stages of ADHD.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For hyperactive children, strategies as simple as changing how they play can have a significant impact on shaping behavior \u2014 and that\u2019s what DeCastro recommended to Churchey. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cHe gave homework for us parents to work on with our child after each appointment,\u201d Churchey said. \u201cMr. Miguel wanted us to get down on the ground with [our son] and have special play time set aside every day to where our son could choose the direction as far as where the play is going to kind of give him a sense of control in that moment, because he wants to control everything.\u201d</span></p>\n<figure style=\"width: 2048px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" data-src=\"https://cnsmaryland.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/DeCastro.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2048\" height=\"1365\" class=\"lazyload\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Miguel DeCastro, a master\u2019s level social work student, poses with a Hoberman Sphere, a tool used to help patients with breathing exercises. (Giuseppe LoPiccolo/Capital News Service)</figcaption></figure>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Physically putting parents at the same level as their children and role playing situations as simple as meeting a new friend on the playground are common homework assignments for parents, DeCastro said.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cAs silly as some of the things were that he gave for homework, it helped,\u201d Churchey said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Little changes like that are an easy way for kids to develop better behavior, DeCastro said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cAll we&#8217;re doing is playing, yes, but we&#8217;re also changing the behaviors,\u201d he said. \u201cWe&#8217;re just meeting kids where they&#8217;re at.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sometimes, though, children need more help after their six weeks with a social worker.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWe&#8217;re a stepping stone to hopefully get them comfortable for a long-term referral later on,\u201d Simpson said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In other cases, though, no referral is needed.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cSome of the things are acute mental health and may only need a few sessions just to try to help patients get in the right direction,\u201d said Dr. Jennifer Wehberg, the founder of Gateway Pediatrics, which has partnered with the internship program since its start. </span></p>\n<h2><b>&#8216;A huge burden lifted&#8217;</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The program\u2019s benefits also extend to pediatricians, who can struggle to keep up with youth behavioral health needs.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWe are not mental health providers. I&#8217;m not a therapist,\u201d said Dr. Anne Rao at Opal Court Pediatrics.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to lacking the training to fully treat mental health issues, some physicians just don\u2019t have the time.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cDepending on what setting you&#8217;re in, doctors can sometimes be under immense pressure to see a certain number of patients per day, and that model of care doesn&#8217;t always align with the unique and complex behavioral health needs that children come in with,\u201d Crosby Budinger said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lacking time to handle one-on-one sessions with patients and families who have concerns, pediatricians have to give referrals to behavioral health professionals.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0\u201cThat\u2019s a challenge because everywhere you go now there&#8217;s a waiting list,\u201d Rao said. \u201cYou can&#8217;t get them into therapy as soon as you prescribe it, so then, there is a time gap and the treatment is delayed for those kids.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even if the patient makes it through a waitlist, there are other challenges to face with starting treatment somewhere else.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThe parents have to take the kid to some other place, and the kid has to get acclimatized with the new environment,\u201d Rao said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With a social work intern in house, these issues \u201cwere all taken out of the picture,\u201d which isn\u2019t only beneficial to parents, she said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cIt\u2019s like a huge burden lifted off of me, too,\u201d Rao said. \u201cI&#8217;m in this business because I care about kids. I want them to thrive, and I want them to get to their best potential.\u201d </span></p>\n<h2><b>A year-round problem</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bronnsen\u2019s annual check-up happened to be in January, but had the appointment been scheduled during the summer, the process would have looked different for the Churchey family.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because the interns are students, the program only runs from August to May, leaving providers on their own for at least two months during summer break.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWe wish it was year-round,\u201d Rao said. \u201cIt is only during the school year, but mental health disorders are there all year-round.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wehberg tried filling the missing months by partnering with a local counseling service, but it just wasn\u2019t the same, she said. Now, during the summer, Gateway goes back to its old referral process.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Furthermore, because the interns juggle attending class and working in the office, interns are not available all days of the week, which can cause scheduling issues for busy working families.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThey have him (DeCastro) on a kind of odd schedule compared to the doctors and nurses, so that was a little difficult with scheduling,&#8221; Churchey said. &#8220;It was very hard for me to be able to be at every appointment.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The six-session cap can also cause parents to worry about having to go through the referral process they thought they had avoided.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI would have no idea where to start or what to do,\u201d Churchey said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0It can also be daunting for a child to switch from one counselor to another.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI was concerned about it before the switch, just because our son liked him (DeCastro) so much,\u201d Churchey said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But even after the sessions were over, DeCastro helped to coordinate Bronnson\u2019s move to Pediatric Movement Center, the pediatric therapy clinic and sensory gym he thought would be the best fit for the boy moving forward.</span></p>\n<h2><b>Hoping to expand</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The leaders of the internship program would like to expand it, Crosby Budinger said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She\u2019d like to offer positions to students at University of Maryland Eastern Shore and open the program to students pursuing careers as licensed clinical professional counselors, but the program\u2019s funding is limited. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cUnfortunately, the folks who have the power to make decisions about how funding is used don&#8217;t always see the value in programs like this,\u201d Crosby Budinger said. \u201cBut in the long term, it will really benefit individuals, and it will benefit our community and society as a whole if we&#8217;re addressing the needs of the whole person.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The program not only provides needed services, but it also contributes to developing the social worker workforce.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since its inception, 114 BHIPP interns have graduated from the program, Crosby Budinger said.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Simpson said the program provides great on-the-job training.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cBeing able to figure out how to work interdisciplinary before you&#8217;re actually entering your professional world, your professional life, is something that a lot of other MSW (master\u2019s of social work) interns aren&#8217;t really getting that opportunity to do,\u201d Simpson said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Social work in a medical setting has become a more viable career path for the interns, Simpson said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cIt&#8217;s definitely something that I would like to pursue, something that I wasn&#8217;t aware was a thing until my introduction to BHIPP,\u201d Simpson said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the meantime, current interns like Simpson and DeCastro are leaving an impact on Maryland youngsters.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cMy son really enjoyed Mr. Miguel,\u201d Churchey said in April. \u201cHe actually still talks about him, and he\u2019s been released now for probably like a month.\u201d</span></p>\n",

            "rendered": "<p>WASHINGTON \u2013 Senate Democrats, including Maryland\u2019s Chris Van Hollen, introduced legislation Thursday that would require the Trump administration to report how it is complying with court orders regarding the wrongful deportation of U.S. citizens and residents to El Salvador.</p>\n<p>The legislation, sponsored by Van Hollen, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York, and Sens. Tim Kaine of Virginia and Alex Padilla of California, also would make the administration confirm the use of American security assistance to support the detention of U.S. residents and assess El Salvador\u2019s human rights record.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you think you can take steps like this without Congress challenging your executive overreach, you\u2019re wrong,\u201d Kaine said at a press conference outside the United States Capitol. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll also send a message to the government of El Salvador, you might think it&#8217;s cute right now to grab attention by a bromance with President Trump, &#8230; and if you think we\u2019ll forget you violating the human rights of American citizens, you\u2019re wrong.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe will remember this forever, and there will be significant and challenging downstream consequences for any nation that violates the rights of Americans,\u201d Kaine said.</p>\n<p>The legislation is \u201cprivileged,\u201d which means the Senate will be forced to vote on the measure, giving Republicans an opportunity to publicly express their views on Trump\u2019s deportation process. The timing of the vote will be negotiated between Schumer and Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-South Dakota.</p>\n<p>Under the legislation, if the administration fails to produce the report, security assistance to El Salvador would be illegal under federal law. If a submitted report was insufficient, the Senate could file additional privileged legislation to terminate security assistance, Kaine said.</p>\n<p>The senators\u2019 move comes in the wake of the wrongful deportation of Maryland resident Kilmar Abrego Garcia.</p>\n<p>A federal judge, an appeals court and the Supreme Court all ordered the administration, which admitted in court last month that the deportation was an error, to facilitate Abrego Garcia\u2019s return. But Trump has refused to do so, even after claiming he had the power to in an interview with ABC News Tuesday.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf he were the gentleman that you say he is, I would do that. But he is not,\u201d Trump said. The president and his administration have claimed Abrego Garcia is a member of the MS-13 gang to justify his deportation.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re not vouching for Kilmar Abrego Garcia,\u201d Van Hollen said Thursday. \u201cWe are vouching for his constitutional rights, because if you trample over his constitutional rights, you threaten them for every American and everyone who resides in America.\u201d</p>\n<p>Van Hollen is the only person outside of El Salvador to speak with Abrego Garcia since his deportation, the senator said. During his time in the country, Van Hollen said he also met with multiple human rights groups, who described mistreatment in prisons by El Salvador\u2019s President Nayib Bukele.</p>\n<p>The Department of State\u2019s 2023 human rights report on the country found there were credible reports of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading punishment in its prisons.</p>\n<p>The United States plans to compensate El Salvador $15 million to house deported residents and has already paid the country roughly $4 million, Van Hollen confirmed.</p>\n<p>\u201cOur pitch to our colleagues would be, \u2018Why wouldn\u2019t you want a human rights report?\u2019\u201d Kaine said. \u201cIf Americans are being sent there, you would want a human rights report about the conditions. So, we have high hopes that we\u2019ll be able to get it passed.\u201d</p>\n",

            "rendered": "<p>WASHINGTON &#8211; Former U.S. ambassadors warned Tuesday that democracy is at serious risk under the Trump presidency, drawing parallels between the administration and past autocracies and urging Americans to stay vigilant.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ve served our nation. We\u2019ve served presidents, Democratic and Republican\u2026we love our democracy and we want to see it continue,\u201d Harry Thomas, former ambassador to Zimbabwe (2016-2018), said at a panel in downtown Washington. \u201cI think criticizing a president is part of democracy\u2014nonviolent criticism is part of democracy.\u201d</p>\n<p>The event, hosted by local bookstore and community space Busboys and Poets, featured a nearly 90-minute discussion between journalist Jon Lee Anderson and four former U.S. diplomats: Thomas, former deputy chief of mission in Moscow Eric Rubin (2008-2011), former ambassador to Panama John Feeley (2015-2018) and former ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch (2016-2019).</p>\n<p>The discussion came a week after the four joined almost 200 other former American diplomats and national security leaders in signing an open letter entitled &#8220;<a href=\"https://cdn.corprensa.com/la-prensa/uploads/2025/04/21/Open%20Letter%20on%20Democracy%20with%20Signatories%20(1)%20(1).pdf\">The Assault on American Democracy: A Call to Action.</a>\u201d The letter warned that U.S. democracy and global leadership are under threat, and said defending them from authoritarianism will require unified, urgent resistance.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe challenge comes from within, as President Trump and his administration have assaulted the pillars of our democracy here at home and our strength around the world,\u201d the letter said. \u201cAmerican democracy and American security are inextricably linked; weaken one and the other inevitably begins to fail\u2026We see that link unraveling at lightning speed.\u201d</p>\n<p>Anderson opened the discussion by outlining what he called the \u201cuniversal autocrat playbook,\u201d a set of tactics historically used by tyrants around the world to turn democracies into dictatorships.</p>\n<p>Among them: eliminating checks and balances, silencing opposition, instilling fear and confusion, attacking the press and spreading disinformation, leveraging nepotism and cronyism, targeting vulnerable groups, promoting exclusionary patriotism, disregarding due process and rewriting the constitution to expand executive power.</p>\n<p>\u201cDoes any of that sound familiar?\u201d Anderson said, referencing the president\u2019s sweeping actions in his first 100 days and laughing alongside the other panelists.</p>\n<p>Using the playbook as a framework, the ambassadors drew comparisons between the Trump administration\u2019s early moves and patterns they witnessed while serving in countries where democratic norms were gradually dismantled.</p>\n<p>\u201cAutocracy is a lot like a virus,\u201d Feeley said, quoting Nicaraguan political activist F\u00e9lix Maradiaga. \u201cIf your body\u2019s autoimmune system doesn\u2019t pick up the virus by the time you show symptoms, it\u2019s probably too late. That\u2019s why we\u2019re here today\u2026This kind of event \u2014 nonviolent, respectful, apolitical \u2014 is about the autoimmune system of a democracy.\u201d</p>\n<p>As Zimbabwe\u2019s democracy crumbled under former President Robert Mugabe, Thomas saw the collapse of the economy along with sharp declines in agriculture and tourism.</p>\n<p>In Russia, Rubin watched President Vladimir Putin\u2019s government weaponize the military against its own people.</p>\n<p>In Nicaragua, Feeley witnessed as President Daniel Ortega stacked leadership positions with loyal friends and family.</p>\n<p>And in Ukraine, before Volodymyr Zelenskyy became president, Yovanovitch saw Russian fear-mongering and threats against educational institutions as the country faced renewed invasion.</p>\n<p>Rubin urged the audience to put aside what he called a uniquely American optimism when evaluating the Trump administration&#8217;s efforts to curtail civil liberties.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf we wake up one morning and you hear about something really terrible, please don\u2019t say there must be an innocent explanation. Please don\u2019t say that in our country, things like this are not intentional,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>Throughout the panel, the diplomats stressed the importance of standing up for democratic values through both individual and collective action, even in the face of repression and fear.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe playbook, as we\u2019ve seen, is to go after the most vulnerable. We need to have community as our shield,\u201d Yovanovitch said. \u201cChange is slow, and then it happens really quickly.\u201d</p>\n",

            "rendered": "<p>After a sluggish start to the year, April&#8217;s box office rebounded this weekend thanks to the historic performances of Ryan Coogler\u2019s horror smash-hit <em>Sinners</em> and the 20th anniversary re-release of <em>Star Wars: Episode III &#8211; Revenge of the Sith</em>.</p>\n<p><em>Sinners</em>, which stars Michael B. Jordan as twins in Depression-era Mississippi, opened to $48 million last weekend, outperforming industry forecasts. This weekend, in its sophomore frame, it earned $45.7 million \u2014 a decline of just 4.8%, significantly below the typical 50\u201360% second-weekend drop most films suffer.</p>\n<div class=\"flourish-embed flourish-chart\" data-src=\"visualisation/22913113\"><script src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js\"></script><noscript><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" data-src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/22913113/thumbnail\" width=\"100%\" alt=\"chart visualization\" class=\"lazyload\" /></noscript></div>\n<p>When the weekend\u2019s dust settled, <em>Sinners</em> landed as the seventh-best second-weekend hold in box office history, outside of the December holiday corridor. The end-of-year box office plays by its own rules due to winter breaks and Christmas crowds, allowing for holds that are nearly impossible to replicate outside of the holiday season \u2014 for films that aren\u2019t <em>Sinners</em>, that is.</p>\n<p>It saw the second-best hold in the horror genre\u2019s history \u2014 only this year\u2019s <em>Heart Eyes</em> fared better, jumping 19% over its opening weekend thanks to a well-timed Valentine\u2019s Day holiday. It was also the second-best hold for any film opening over $40 million, right behind <em>Avatar</em>\u2019s 1.8% drop, although the James Cameron blockbuster benefited from its late December release date.</p>\n<p><em>Sinners</em> has torn through numerous Hollywood records since its debut. It\u2019s the best-reviewed horror film in history \u2014 the first from its genre to receive an A Cinemascore rating from moviegoers \u2014 and it scored the largest opening weekend gross for an original film since <em>Us</em> in 2019, another Black auteur-led horror sensation.</p>\n<p>Coogler\u2019s film wasn\u2019t the only standout of the weekend. Far, far away from <em>Sinners</em>\u2019 vampiric horrors, <em>Revenge of the Sith</em>, which charts Darth Vader\u2019s rise and the Clone Wars\u2019 end, returned to theaters with force, opening with $25.5 million domestically and pulling in $43.2 million globally.</p>\n<div class=\"flourish-embed\" data-src=\"story/3070045\"><script src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js\"></script><noscript><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" data-src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/story/3070045/thumbnail\" width=\"100%\" alt=\"visualization\" class=\"lazyload\" /></noscript></div>\n<p><em>Revenge of the Sith</em>, which originally debuted in May 2005, is the latest re-release to make a splash at the box office this decade, following <em>Avatar</em> and <em>Coraline</em>\u2019s returns to theaters in 2022 and 2024 respectively. The Disney-distributed sci-fi epic is on track to eclipse the grosses of both by the end of its one-week run on Wednesday.</p>\n<p>The final film of George Lucas\u2019 prequel trilogy notched the third-largest domestic opening weekend for a re-release in box office history, behind just <em>The Lion King</em>\u2019s $30 million in 2011 and <em>A New Hope</em>\u2019s $36 million in 1997, becoming the 16th-highest-grossing re-release of all time in just three days.</p>\n<p>The Star Wars franchise has been a major player in theatrical re-releases for over 40 years, earning over half a billion dollars from the limited engagements since the original 1977 film returned to theaters in 1982. The 1997 special edition of <em>Star Wars</em>, when it was retitled with the <em>A New Hope</em> subheader, remains the highest-grossing theatrical re-release with $138.3 million.</p>\n<p>The weekend was rounded out by <em>The Accountant 2</em> and <em>The Minecraft Movie</em>, which grossed $24.5 million and $22.7 million respectively. It was the first time four films each grossed over $20 million in a single weekend in nearly two years, since <em>Meg 2: The Trench</em> and <em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem</em> opened against the third weekend of the Barbenhaimer phenomenon. Overall, this weekend was up 128% from the same frame in 2024.</p>\n<div class=\"flourish-embed flourish-chart\" data-src=\"visualisation/22752125\"><script src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js\"></script><noscript><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" data-src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/22752125/thumbnail\" width=\"100%\" alt=\"chart visualization\" class=\"lazyload\" /></noscript></div>\n<p>It\u2019s a promising sign for movie theaters, which have faced a lack of blockbuster product since the COVID-19 pandemic, despite a growing number of annual theatrical releases.</p>\n<p>Between 2010 and 2019, the 10 highest-grossing films each year made up an average of 31% of the annual domestic box office. Since 2020, that figure has jumped to 46.5%, which can cause months-long dry spells for theaters, like the earlier this year when annual box office sales trailed 2024 by nearly 12%.</p>\n<p>Thanks to hits like <em>The Minecraft Movie</em>, <em>Sinners</em> and <em>Revenge of Sith</em> driving audiences back to theaters, 2025 now holds an 11% lead over the year prior, with a gauntlet of summer tentpoles on the horizon.</p>\n",

This sweeping purge, widely seen as an attempt to eliminate oversight of Trump\u2019s second administration, sparked a lawsuit challenging its legality and fueled ongoing protests outside federal agencies.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>JAN. 28</strong> | Day 9</p>\n<h3>OPM sends federal workers \u2018Fork in the Road\u2019 email</h3>\n<p>More than 2 million federal employees received an email from the Office of Personnel Management titled \u201c<a href=\"https://www.opm.gov/fork/original-email-to-employees/\">Fork in the Road</a>,\u201d introducing a new program called deferred resignation. The program allows employees to submit resignations effective Sept. 30 in exchange for full pay, benefits and an exemption from return-to-work mandates until that date. The email hinted that employees who take the buyout might be placed on paid administrative leave or have reduced workloads, although it made no guarantees. The subject line mirrored an email sent to Twitter employees after Musk\u2019s takeover, underscoring DOGE\u2019s growing power in reshaping the federal workforce. The announcement triggered widespread backlash, with federal workers organizing nationwide protests under the banner \u201cFork Off.\u201d</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>JAN. 30 </strong>| Day 11</p>\n<h3>Trump links fatal plane collision to DEI initiatives</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Without providing any evidence, Trump </span><a href=\"https://cnsmaryland.org/2025/01/30/without-evidence-trump-blames-dei-hires-and-democrats-for-deadly-plane-collision/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">blamed diversity policies</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> from the Obama and Biden administrations for the fatal Jan. 29 collision between a jetliner and a helicopter near the Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport.

Immigration</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cracking down on illegal immigration was a leading topic in the Trump campaign, where he set his attention on the millions of undocumented immigrants that live in the United States. He followed through on this during his first 100 days, where the U.S Immigration Customs and Enforcement agency has taken unprecedented steps into workplaces and schools.\u00a0 The chart below is from October 2024-February 2025.\u00a0</span></p>\n<div class=\"flourish-embed flourish-chart\" data-src=\"visualisation/22055326\"><script src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js\"></script><noscript><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" data-src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/22055326/thumbnail\" width=\"100%\" alt=\"chart visualization\" class=\"lazyload\" /></noscript></div>\n<hr />\n<h2><b>3.

            "rendered": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ANNAPOLIS\u2013 On its face, Gov. Moore\u2019s recent trade mission to Japan and Korea was nothing unusual. Maryland\u2019s governors have long embarked on missions overseas to establish economic ties.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moore, though, said that his role as Maryland\u2019s chief executive has changed with what he refers to as the chaos coming from Washington. The recent trip, planned before Trump took office, offered a clear picture as to how.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the face of Trump\u2019s \u201cerratic tariff policies,\u201d Moore said, the mission became an opportunity for the state to build relationships independent of Washington.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI think that one of the things that was really encouraging from the folks in both Japan and Korea was that, in Maryland, what they found was stability,\u201d Moore said in an exclusive interview with Capital News Service in the wake of his trip. \u201cIn Maryland, what they found was a confidence in the decision making.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moore\u2019s words were purposeful. As a leader, he wants to be an answer, a stark contrast, to what he sees in Washington.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI think that, actually, the best thing you can do in a moment of chaos is to show calm and to show courage,\u201d Moore said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s the type of leadership that I want to be able to provide.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maryland has a chance to \u201cshow that there is a different way,\u201d Moore says, referencing the tax reform and budget cuts that he achieved during the legislative session.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWe\u2019re actually decreasing the size of the general fund, decreasing the size of state government and producing outsized results. \u201cAnd so I think the thing that I want people to know about our leadership is that we are calm, is that we are steady, and that we actually produce results that people are looking for in their lives.\u201d\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The jury, though, remains out on what those results look like in practice.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moore spent much of the 2025 legislative session selling his tax plan to Marylanders. The idea was almost too good to be true. He said that the vast majority of the state\u2019s residents will either see a tax cut or no change at all.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But, throughout the session, that concept took a beating. Moore and the legislature added many new taxes and fees. Some were extremely unpopular, leading many to wonder if the budget </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">actually</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> makes living in Maryland, already an expensive proposition, any more affordable.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Producing results will be even more challenging under a Trump administration that is far less likely to lend a helping hand than its predecessor. Maryland has long been dependent on the federal government as a pillar of its economy, but if early results are any indication, those dollars will not be as free-flowing going forward.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The last few months, and the months and years that lie ahead, represent one of the first true political challenges that Moore will face after a relatively charmed first two years under a friendly Biden administration. It represents a test for the first-term governor, a proving ground for his political present and future.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But Moore is nothing if not aspirational.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Three months ago, staring down a $3 billion deficit and a looming Trump administration that many projected would be unfriendly to deep-blue Maryland, the state\u2019s governor maintained that this would be \u201cMaryland\u2019s decade,\u201d and that growth would be his and the state\u2019s \u201cNorth Star.\u201d\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the Trump administration proved itself to be unfriendly to the state, Moore\u2019s optimistic ambition persisted. As measures such as culling the federal workforce and announcing an intent to prevent the FBI headquarters moving to Maryland came through, Moore called for lawmakers to \u201cconfront crisis with courage.\u201d\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The governor\u2019s brand of hopeful politics, and his emphasis on putting Maryland and its residents over party allegiance, has endeared him to many in his state. Even through an extremely challenging legislative session, people lined up after events just for a moment, a picture or a handshake with Moore.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That magnetism has forced Moore into the national spotlight. As a Democratic Party still reeling from a massive material defeat looks to fill a leadership void, Moore\u2019s name keeps coming up.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In many ways, Moore does see himself as the leader for this moment. But he intends to be that leader for Maryland.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI think people are really happy that, in Maryland, we\u2019re moving fast and we\u2019re moving smart,\u201d Moore said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWhen I said this is Maryland\u2019s decade, I meant that,\u201d Moore said. \u201cAnd I plan on seeing that through.\u201d\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Much of what he wants to see through \u2013 and the effort that Moore thinks will make this \u201cMaryland\u2019s decade\u201d \u2013 is a fostering of growth in the private sector. He sees it as a way to unentangle Maryland, which has long been reliant on Washington, from the federal government, at least economically.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cParticularly when you have a federal government that is literally attacking our state, and attacking our federal workers\u2026 what are the industries that we think we have a significant growth opportunity in?\u201d\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s not a new refrain. Moore has beaten the drum of building up Maryland\u2019s \u201clighthouse industries,\u201d which include aerospace, defense and life sciences, for months. But he\u2019s also increasingly acting on it, with the overseas trip an opportunity to grow relationships in areas like AI, cyber and quantum computing.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The plan has its share of doubters. Quantum computing, </span><a href=\"https://cnsmaryland.org/2025/01/14/gov-moore-hopes-to-make-maryland-the-quantum-capital-of-the-world/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">one of the industries Moore has poured extensive resources into</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, serves as an example. While Moore has earmarked quantum as a significant economic boost, many still think quantum is still years, if not decades, away from viability. And in some of those lighthouse industries, Maryland has a stiff competitor in neighboring Virginia, a battle that Maryland has often found itself on the losing side of.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And, while Moore has promised a dedication to small business growth, many Republicans think that the policies he and Democrats in Annapolis have enacted run counter to that goal.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cMaryland has a continuing reputation of not being business friendly, not being entrepreneur friendly,\u201d House Republican Leader Jason Buckel, who represents Allegany County, told CNS on the last day of session.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Del. Jesse Pippy, the House Republican Whip, took aim at Moore\u2019s tax reform as a burden on Maryland and its economy.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWe have the largest tax increase in Maryland history, nearly $1.7 billion,\u201d Pippy, who represents Frederick County, told CNS on the last day of session. \u201cThis is just completely unnecessary, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s what the majority of Marylanders are looking for, regardless of their political affiliation.\u201d\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even if Moore\u2019s targeted investments and overall economic strategy prove to be prudent, with constant challenges on the federal level, it\u2019s going to be harder to achieve the same results.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWe\u2019re going to have to be aggressive in the way that we are communicating it,\u201d Moore said of his efforts to keep Maryland moving forward under Trump, \u201cbecause the people are experiencing it right now, and they\u2019re experiencing in real time.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI have just spoken with countless Marylanders who now have lost their jobs,\u201d Moore said, \u201cin many ways arbitrarily and in many ways illegally.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moore said that one man, a Republican, stuck out to him.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cHe said he still has not told his kids that he was laid off from his job,\u201d Moore said. \u201cIn fact, he gets up in the morning and he puts on a suit so his kids see him in a suit, so they don\u2019t know that he got laid off. This is real for Maryland families, and Maryland families are seeing this every day.\u201d\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moore said that he doesn\u2019t need to remind Maryland families of \u201cthe chaos that this Trump administration is bringing\u201d to Marylanders, but that they need to be \u201cassured\u201d that \u201cwe are doing anything and everything in our power\u201d to protect them from \u201csomething that is deeply disruptive and deeply disturbing.\u201d\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In doing so, Moore is open to working with Trump and Washington going forward \u2013 in fact, he said that he \u201cwill work with anybody who wants to work with [Maryland].\u201d But he isn\u2019t willing to compromise his values to do it.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWhile I will work with anyone, I will bow down to no one,\u201d Moore said. \u201cAnd if the requirement for partnership is ceding my values, if the requirement for a partnership is somehow kowtowing or curling up in a fetal position, if the requirement is allowing my people to be left behind, then the answer is, I will never surrender to you.\u201d</span></p>\n",

A few years later, he and his colleagues created the Behavior Intervention Monitoring Assessment System, or BIMAS.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cIt was identifying kiddos, students, through parents or through teacher ratings and the kids themselves who were able to tell us, \u2018Hey, we are OK, some of us are not as OK and some of us really need lots of supports,\u2019\u201d</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Bardos said.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The BIMAS \u2014 now the BIMAS-2 \u2014\u00a0 is one of several behavioral health screenings used in schools throughout the United States. Yet amid a youth mental health crisis that, according to federal statistics, means 40% of high schoolers reported feeling sad or hopeless in 2023,</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> computer-based mental health screenings remain fairly uncommon in America\u2019s public schools.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A </span><a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/10598405211056647\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2021 survey</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> found 12.8% of school districts that responded have policies calling for mental health screenings.</span> <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.3102/00028312211000043\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another study</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> from that same year found only 5.4% of schools offered behavioral health screenings to all their students.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bardos said no Maryland schools use his company\u2019s screening tool. But other screening tools are in use in the state\u2019s schools, said Sharon Hoover, co-director of the </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">National Center for School Mental Health, which is based at the University of Maryland School of Medicine.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cHowever, schools also may have concerns about being responsible for universal screening of students because they may then feel responsible for addressing any identified issues,\u201d Hoover said. \u201cOften schools do not have the resources to implement and respond to mental health screening, especially if done without community partnerships.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In some cases, then, schools only use screening tools in particular grades. At the Green Bay Area Public School District in Wisconsin, for example, fifth- and eighth-graders are the only ones screened. Christina Gingle, a school official in Green Bay, said screenings the district uses allow staffers to more quickly identify students in need.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She said the BIMAS-2 </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201chas greatly strengthened our ability to be able to support the mental wellness of our </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">students.\u201d</span></p>\n<h2><b>What\u2019s in a screening?</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bardos is now CEO of EduMetrisis, the company that publishes the BIMAS-2,</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> which calls on respondents to fill out a </span><a href=\"https://edumetrisis.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/bimas2-SELF-REPORT-Standard-Form-FINAL.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">34-question form</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> The respondent can either be a teacher, a parent, the student themself or a combination of the three.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bardos said schools can begin screening students as early as pre-K. The earlier a school implements screenings and follows up with the appropriate interventions, the better the outcome is going to be, he said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The respondent fills out the form online and the responses are immediately collected in a database for school officials to examine.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> It takes about five minutes to fill out the form, Bardos said.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The form asks the respondent to rate whether the student has performed a specific behavior in the past week on a five-point scale from never to very often.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> The questions range from how often the student followed directions to how often they threatened or bullied others.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another question asks students how often they have thought of hurting themselves. Bardos said that question gives the first initial indication that a student needs help.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cIt&#8217;s just a little opening to a box that says to you, \u2018Please take a look at me,\u2019\u201d he said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another common behavioral health screening is the Devereux Student Strengths Assessment, or DESSA.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That screener evaluates students on six different competencies: optimistic thinking, relationship skills, self-management, responsible decision-making, social awareness and self-awareness.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Like the BIMAS-2, respondents complete the DESSA online.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Respondents can be students, teachers or parents.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> The respondent, like in the BIMAS-2, is asked how often the student performs a certain behavior on a five-point scale from never to almost always.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some of the questions include: \u201cDuring the past four weeks, how often did the student keep trying when unsuccessful?\u201d and \u201cDuring the past four weeks, how often did the student believe they can achieve their goals?\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The DESSA groups students into three different categories based on how they respond to its questions: strength, typical and need for instruction \u2014</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> equivalent to above average, average and below average.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are two versions of the DESSA. DESSA-mini is a shorter, eight-question form meant to serve as a benchmark for districts and help them gather information about the entire student body, said Evelyn Johnson, vice president for research at Riverside Insights, the company that publishes the screening tool.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The full DESSA assessment, which can evaluate individual students, has 40 questions. Middle and high school students can complete the assessment on their own.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Just like Bardos\u2019 test, the DESSA can be used with students in grades K-12.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Equipped with information from the DESSA, \u201cschools can start thinking about: How can I help this student build on the strengths they already are demonstrating to then develop skills in other areas that are going to serve them well?\u201d Johnson said</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<h2><b>Screenings in schools</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In its </span><a href=\"https://www.schoolmentalhealth.org/media/som/microsites/ncsmh/documents/quality-guides/Screening.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">screening guide</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the National Center for School Mental Health recommends schools start small when they begin screening students \u2014 and that&#8217;s what the Green Bay area schools did.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The district is in its second year of implementing the BIMAS-2. Gingle, the district\u2019s associate director of pupil services,</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> said district officials favored a slow rollout to make sure they could address students\u2019 concerns, especially if they mentioned self-harm.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The district chose to only screen students in the fifth and eighth grades because those are critical times in their lives \u2014 just before they transition from elementary school to middle school and from middle school to high school.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gingle said the district created an intervention guide and conducted trainings for teachers, administrators and parents before implementing the screening tool.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI think it has been really well-received and [is] hopefully preventing any types of crises and keeping students in really that least restrictive setting to receive the level of needed care,\u201d she said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In Northern Virginia, Alexandria City Public Schools took a more comprehensive approach by screening all students from kindergarten to grade 12.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWhat we&#8217;re trying to do is identify those life skills students have already learned and things, but also try to enhance ones that might need to be developed as it relates to social emotional competencies,\u201d said Victor Martin, the district\u2019s executive director of student support teams.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Martin\u2019s district has been using the DESSA for three years.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> He said the district chose to use that screening tool because it measures social and emotional learning, or the process in which people develop their identities, manage their emotions and create relationships.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The district screens students twice a year. Teachers fill out a shorter assessment for students in kindergarten through eighth grade. It takes about two minutes to fill out the form for each student, Martin said.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In high school, students complete a longer assessment on their own. It takes them about 20 minutes to complete, according to Martin.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The district then compiles the data and uses it to help its student support teams and teachers provide small group instruction, while other students may be referred for individual or online counseling.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cPerhaps you might see that an entire grade level is maybe struggling with relationship skills, and maybe that&#8217;s an opportunity for us, in collaboration with the classroom teacher, to work on providing lessons that might help with building relationship skills,\u201d Martin said.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Using that approach, some schools in the district have seen entire grade levels improve from the fall assessment to the spring assessment.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWe&#8217;ve seen students improve to a strengths-based level because of strategies and interventions that have been put in place by those schools,\u201d Martin said.</span></p>\n<h2><b>A reluctance to screen</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Students in Green Bay and Alexandria can opt out of the screenings if their parents prefer \u2014 but elsewhere, many school districts are entirely opting out of behavioral health screenings, or limiting their use, for a number of reasons.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A </span><a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/27262155?seq=1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2023 poll</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> published in Phi Delta Kappan found the public has mixed views on mental health assessments in schools. Of those that responded to the survey, 45% said schools should assess students only when their parents or guardians request it, 39% said schools should assess all students and 14% said schools should not assess students.</span></p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" data-src=\"https://cnsmaryland.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Mental-health-screenings-chart.png\" class=\"lazyload\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sometimes school officials worry parents are going to be upset if their children are screened, said Elizabeth Connors, an associate professor of psychiatry at Yale School of Medicine.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She said that worry is often unfounded.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> \u201cI don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s often that much resistance, but it certainly does happen,\u201d she said. \u201cSo that&#8217;s why we encourage schools to be reaching out to their parents.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yet the screenings have caused a stir in some places. When Wake County schools in North Carolina implemented the BIMAS-2, some parents objected to the idea that teachers would be evaluating the behavioral health of their students.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8220;I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s fair to put the teachers in the position to have to analyze the students in this way,\u201d Rachael Ayscue, the parent of a high schooler, told ABC11 in Raleigh-Durham in 2019. \u201cThey&#8217;re educated in the curriculum that they&#8217;re teaching, not in behavioral science.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Students sometimes object to the screenings, too. In 2022, Isaiah Steinberg, at the time a student at Jamesville-Dewitt High School in upstate New York, wrote an essay criticizing the BIMAS-2 in the school newspaper, the RamPage. He said students were reluctant to complete the screening, and for a good reason.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThe truth is that J-D students are nervous that they will be singled out by their counselors and administrators, people who they often do not know or trust very well,\u201d Steinberg wrote.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another potential limitation of mental health screenings is the cost. For example, it would cost a school district the size of Green Bay over $70,000 each year to use the BIMAS-2.</span></p>\n<h2><b>Signs of success</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There\u2019s evidence, though, that the screenings do some good.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A March 2025 study by University of Nebraska researchers found the BIMAS-2 \u201c</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">effectively identifies at-risk students, offering an effective approach to addressing adolescent mental health needs in rural communities.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And a</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> 2017 study of low-income kindergarteners evaluated with the DESSA found the screening accurately evaluated their </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">self-awareness, self-management, social awareness, relationship skills and responsible decision-making</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Both Gingle and Martin mentioned screenings are just one data point they look at when they consider a child\u2019s mental well-being.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Martin said Alexandria schools wouldn\u2019t automatically put a child into therapy based on the results of the screening. \u201cWe would take that in consideration with attendance and grades and disciplinary reasons and concerns from the teacher,\u201d he said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Connors said that\u2019s the right approach. She likens mental health screenings to vision screenings in schools.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cJust because you, you know, fail that vision screening, it doesn&#8217;t mean that you need glasses. You actually need to go to the optometrist, and they&#8217;re going to have sharper tools there,\u201d she said.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A lower score on the screening just means that school officials should follow up with those students and understand whether the student would benefit from some kind of service, she added.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite the occasional concerns of parents and students elsewhere, Gingle and Martin said the response from parents to the screenings in their schools has been positive.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Both said their districts have made sure to do outreach to parents to make sure they understand the screenings and how they are conducted.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Connors said when school districts start doing mental health screenings, they begin to understand their students have a lot of mental health needs that, without screenings, may have gone unnoticed.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cOnce you identify one student who otherwise might have fallen through the cracks, you realize how essential this is to supporting student mental health and well-being and success,\u201d Connors said.</span></p>\n<p><em>Clarification: An earlier version of this story said DESSA had 72 questions, but that was for the assessment&#8217;s previous version. The updated version of DESSA includes 40 questions, and the story has been edited to reflect that fact.</em></p>\n",
